# Indy-Connection-Tutorial

This tutorial concerns setting up a connecton to a server using the Indy components.  It was created due to the lack of examples on the web as to how to effectively do this.  It will use an example to connection to an NNTP server.  The IDE used is from CodeTyphon.

It will demonstrate these connections:  
 utNoTLSSupport (no SSL secure connection)  
 utUseExplicitTLS and utUseImplicitTLS (both types of SSL secure connection).

<p>
